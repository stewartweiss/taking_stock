## Taking Stock

To "take stock" means to make an appraisal of resources and potentialities.<sup>1</sup>

The purpose of this repository is to act as a container for a collection of
files related to your taking stock of your aspirations, requirements, and
potential for contributing to open source projects.
It is a _private repository_, so that you can feel comfortable knowing that
only two people can read it - you and your instructor.

###  The First File: Goals


The initial file in the repository is named __Goals.md__.
It should contain a  list of the various things you hope to accomplish in
this course, and beyond, in the big wide world of open source software.

Each item in this list should be _specific, concise, and actionable_,
meaning you can actually do that item. The items should therefore be
verbs or _gerunds_ (verbs turned into nouns, like learning.)

For example, "practicing programming" is vague rather than specific,
whereas "improving my web design skills" is specific and actionable -
you can see the difference in your skills from when you start
to when you stop and evaluate what you have done.
"Becoming proficient in Git" is actionable and somewhat specific,
but proficiency is a moving target - you need to decide what criteria
make someone proficient in Git.

###  The Second File: Resources

The second file in this repository is named __Resources.md__.
It should contain a list of the skills that you can leverage to make a
contribution. For example, what programming languages are your strong ones,
or what other skills do you have? Are you bilingual? Are you good with
specific applications like web design or digital photography.

Other resources are your time and availability. How much time can you give
to a project? Are there periods of time in which you are more available or
not available at all?

### The Third File: Interests

The third file is named __Interests.md__.
It should contain a list of all those things that interest you such as your hobbies,
recreational activities, subjects that you have a passion for, even if it is also
a school subject. Do you like music? Do you play an instrument? Do you read certain
types of books? Do you fix cars or repair old computers or knit or make clothing?
It all goes in this file.
